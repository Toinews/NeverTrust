# NeverTrust

This repo is here to introduce people a problem they can face while
downloading binaries directly from the Internet. Even if the source code can be
provided it doesn't mean it is linked to the binary you're executing.

I can even provide you with the sha256 if needed, the problem is still the same,
you cannot prove the binary is the good one. At least, in this example you could easily
prove it is not the good one.
